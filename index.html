      <h1>Amped AI Has Closed</h1>
      <p>
        The Amped AI experiment has concluded, and the station is now offline.
      </p>
      <p>
        It began as a way to test what fully AI-generated radio could become,
        how far it could go, where it would succeed, and where it would fall
        short. Along the way, it proved that AI can create atmosphere and
        consistency, but it also reaffirmed the value of human intent and
        judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amped AI was never meant to replace people. It was built to explore
        ideas and push boundaries. In that sense, it did exactly what it was
        meant to do.
